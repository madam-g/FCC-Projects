            <p>Baroness Kathleen Annie Pannonica de Koenigswarter was born a black sheep to the Rothschild family (yes, those Rothschilds), but to her friends in the jazz scene, she was a spirited woman who worked on elevating herself and those around her. While on a stopover in New York, she caught up with an old friend, Teddy Wilson, the great swing-era pianist (who, at one time, taught her brother piano). David Kastin divulged on NPR's <em>All Things Considered</em>:
<br><br>
"...The story goes that he told her that she had to hear this new pianist. He sat her down and played Monk's 'Round Midnight.'"She burst into tears. She had him play the record 20 times in a row. She missed her flight. Stayed in New York for a couple of more weeks. Headed home, and before long, she was back in New York permanently."</p>
              
<p>In New York, de Koenigswarter became a friend and patron of many prominent jazz musicians, hosting jam sessions in her hotel suite, and lending them her chauffeur and Rolls Royce when they needed a lift to performances. She is sometimes referred to as the "bebop baroness" or "jazz baroness" because of her patronage of Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker among others. Following Parker's death in her Stanhope rooms in 1955, de Koenigswarter was asked to leave by the hotel management; she re-located to the Bolivar Hotel at 230 Central Park West, a building commemorated in Thelonious Monk's 1956 tune "Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are". </p>

<p>She was introduced to Thelonious Monk by jazz pianist/composer Mary Lou Williams in Paris while attending the "Salon du Jazz 1954", and championed his work in the USA, writing the liner notes for his 1962 Columbia album Criss-Cross, and even took criminal responsibility when she and Monk were charged with marijuana possession by the police. After Monk ended his public performances in the mid-1970s he retired to de Koenigswarter's house in Weehawken, New Jersey, where he died in 1982.</p>
              
<p>Koenigswarter died in 1988, aged 74, at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, in New York City. She had five children, two grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.</p>
            
<p>In 2006, the French publishing company Buchet Chastel posthumously released her book <em>Les musiciens de jazz et leurs trois vœux</em> (printed in English as <em>Three Wishes: an Intimate Look at Jazz Greats</em>) in which Nica had compiled answers from 300 musicians who told her what their "three wishes" would be and is accompanied by her Polaroid photographs.</p>
